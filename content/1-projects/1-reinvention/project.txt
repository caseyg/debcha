I write a regular column, “Reinvention”, for the American Society for Engineering Education’s Prism magazine.

The focus of the column is changing ideas and norms in engineering education. Recent columns have discussed technology in the classroom, the role of self-efficacy in learning, and moving away from the post-World War II ‘culture of order’ in engineering.
