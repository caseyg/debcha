    I write a regular column,
    “Reinvention”, for the American
    Society for Engineering Education’s
    Prism magazine.

  text: 'The focus of the column is changing ideas and norms in engineering education. Recent columns have discussed [technology in the classroom](http://www.asee-prism.org/reinvention-sum/), the role of [self-efficacy in learning](http://www.asee-prism.org/reinvention-dec-2/), and moving away from the post-World War II ‘[culture of order](http://www.asee-prism.org/reinvention-dec/)’ in engineering.'

  text: '[A] generation out from my own undergraduate engineering degree, I’ve spent a surprising amount of time unlearning what I learned in college, and I work with engineering educators to help them do likewise.'

    Demographic differences, such as gender,
    among engineering students don’t
    necessarily mean that we need to design
    different experiences for each group...
    Rather, any observed differences between
    genders are telling us that we have an
    axis along which the student experience
    varies; what we need to do, then, is
    design educational experiences that work
    for students along the entire axis.

  text: '[W]e live in a connected world where collaboration is becoming easier. Accordingly, we ask our engineering students to work in teams, and we often talk about leadership. But we rarely provide examples of either, leading our students to find their own models of teamwork and leadership. Many look to the military, hierarchical corporations, and the traditional patriarchal family.'

  text: 'What has changed for “kids these days” is, of course, the culture they live in. For engineering students, there are three major elements of this: the rise of the knowledge economy; the decline of stable, long-term employment; and advances in technology.'

    But women in engineering are told, in a
    host of small and subtle ways, that
    engineering is not for them. We see the
    effects of this in lower self-efficacy,
    higher dropout rates, and lower
    satisfaction in engineering.

    Today, discussions about revamping
    engineering education often focus on the
    nation’s need to maintain a
    competitive economic advantage, as if
    commerce, technology, and innovation
    were a zero-sum game….But the reality
    is, our social, economic, and
    environmental systems are globally
    intertwined.

  text: 'As educators, we should ask what values are being incorporated into the design of MOOCs. For a start, most MOOCs embody a particular pedagogical approach: that knowledge is transferred from an expert to a newcomer, rather than something that is constructed by the learner by their engagement.'

  text: 'But here’s the problem: From a learning standpoint, this approach misses the mark. Our engineering students aren’t the A-Team. They’re assigned the project as a learning exercise. If all the students do what they are best at, there’s a good chance they’ll end up minimizing what the team learns.'

    Teamwork, particularly early in a
    student’s education, isn’t just
    about efficient division of labor.
    Consider the first-year design team that
    builds a great prototype. If everyone in
    the group took on the task he or she
    already knew how to do well...the
    exercise is a failure. The point of an
    engineering course is not what students
    accomplish; it’s what they learn.

    But the types of problems we expect
    engineering graduates to be able to
    address, such as the National Academy of
    Engineering’s Grand Challenges,
    involve complex interactions of
    technology, systems, and society. How do
    we help our graduates develop the ways
    of thinking they’ll need in order to
    address these types of problems?

    We talk the talk — we ask our students
    to wrestle with new material every day
    — but we need to walk the walk
    ourselves, by learning new content or
    skills and bringing them to the
    classroom.
