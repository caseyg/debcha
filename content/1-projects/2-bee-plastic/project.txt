  text: "*Colletes inaequalis*, a solitary bee that is native to the Northeast United States, is also known as the 'polyester bee'. In the spring, the bees dig thimble-sized underground nest cells, line each nest cell with a cellophane-like plastic, provision them with pollen and nectar, and then deposit a single egg in each cell before sealing it with more plastic."

    We've been collecting and analysing these nests, including showing that there is also silk in the nest cell lining; itâ€™s therefore a composite, closely akin to fiberglass. We presented this work at the Materials Research Society Spring Meetings in 2011 and [2016](http://www.mrs.org/spring-2016-symposium-sessions/spring-2016-symposia/?code=SM9). One of my research students at Olin College of Engineering, Rebecca Belisle, received a Fulbright Fellowship to [continue this work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-011-5624-3) with a related species, *Colletes thoracicus*.
