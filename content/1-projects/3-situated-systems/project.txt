    Our multidisciplinary team explored how
    the long history of military
    infrastructure and projects in the Bay
    Area has shaped (and continues to shape)
    technology culture, and we communicated
    our findings primarily through physical
    objects that we fabricated. The project
    website includes background information,
    documentation, and online resources.
