    I write an intermittent newsletter, [Metafoundry](https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry) (with thanks to [Warren Ellis](http://www.warrenellis.com) for the name). I mostly talk about technology and culture and other obsessions of mine.

    WIRED included it as one of their ["21 Must-Follow Feeds for Business"](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/21-must-follow-feeds-world-business/) and it's on this [WNYC list](http://www.wnyc.org/story/newsletter-round-up/) of 'newsletters you'll actually be glad to see in your inbox'. But my favorite description of it comes from Clive Thompson, in his [WIRED piece](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/rise-of-the-newsletter/) on newsletters:
    
    > The pleasure in reading a newsletter comes from the view into a unitary mind at workâ€”like my single favorite newsletter, *Metafoundry*, by my friend Debbie Chachra, a materials scientist. Reading it is like being plugged Oculus-style into her brain while she meditates on science and culture.
