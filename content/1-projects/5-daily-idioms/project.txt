  text: '[Daily Idioms, Annotated](http://dailyidioms.tumblr.com/) began with me just posting strange and dissonant phrases to my [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/debcha), where people like Cory Doctorow of [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net) [shared my joy](http://boingboing.net/2011/10/02/daily-idioms-hypothetical-buzzwords.html).'

    I started a [Tumblr](http://dailyidioms.tumblr.com/)  so I could link out to the sources of the phrases, which lead to all sorts of weird corners of human knowledge. I talk more about the project in this [short interview](http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2012/10/polymath_alert.html) with the Boston Globe, and the screenshot here is pulled from this [brief appreciation](https://dictionaryperson.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/present-at-the-creation-daily-idioms-annotated/).
