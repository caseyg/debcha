    Issues around gender and STEM (science,
    technology, engineering and mathematics)
    have been a running theme in my
    professional work. It begins, of course,
    with my own experiences in engineering
    (including being an undergraduate
    student at the time of the Ecole
    Polytechnique shootings), and carries
    through my work with students at Olin
    College, which has had an institutional
    commitment to gender parity since its
    very first class. It’s an ongoing
    theme of my research in engineering
    education, and my colleagues and I
    regularly run workshops on gender and
    STEM for engineering and other
    educators. I’ve also written, spoken,
    and consulted on gender to broader
    audiences, ranging from writing for a
    comic book, to speaking at the SXSW
    Interactive Conference, to consulting
    work with the senior leadership of an
    advertising agency. Improving
    inclusivity and diversity is a theme
    that runs through nearly everything I do
    professionally.
