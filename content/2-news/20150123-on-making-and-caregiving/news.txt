I wrote about how we overvalue making and undervalue caregiving for my [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry/letters/metafoundry-15-scribbled-leatherjackets), and [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/) asked permission to publish a version at their site. I'm really delighted at how strongly this piece has resonated with people all over the world.
