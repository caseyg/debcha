I was invited by [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/) to contribute a piece to their series, ["Can Technology Rescue Democracy?"](https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/can-technology-rescue-democracy/) I decided to write about infrastructure and our large-scale systems, like the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Aviation Authority, GPS, and more.

> When we think about caring for our neighbors, we think about local churches, and charities—systems embedded in our communities. But I see these technological systems as one of the main ways that we take care of each other at scale. It’s how Americans care for all three hundred million of our neighbors, rich or poor, spread over four million square miles, embedded in global supply chains.
