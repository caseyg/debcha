I was delighted to be invited to speak at the brilliant (link: http://eyeofestival.com/ text: Eyeo Festival) in Minneapolis this year. I gave a talk about the last two hundred or so years, and the next fifty or so years of engineering structures, in which I argue that increasing computational power, embedded sensors, and the ability to carry out fabrication *in situ* means that architecture is approaching the geometries and responsiveness to mechanical force of tissues in organisms. And yes, I was indeed delighted at the chance to spend fifteen minutes explaining bone biology to a roomful of designers.
