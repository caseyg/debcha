I was invited to give a talk at the (link: http://designstudies.wixsite.com/symposium text: Matter[ing] by Design) symposium at Parsons/New School, and I spoke about gender differences and design, including Lego, snowboards, artificial hearts, and engineering education. My talk starts at the 19 minute mark, but I highly recommend the talk that follows mine (at 35min) by (link: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/technology/intels-sharp-eyed-social-scientist.html?_r=0 text: Genevieve Bell), an anthropologist, who was then at Intel.
