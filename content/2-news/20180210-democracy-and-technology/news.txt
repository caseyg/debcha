This past February, the University of California Irvine's (link: http://sites.uci.edu/forum/ text: Forum for the Academy and the Public) hosted a (link: http://sites.uci.edu/americanidentity/ text: symposium) called, "Who Do We Think We Are? American Identity and the Ideal of Democracy in the 21st Century." I was invited to speak on a panel on "Democracy and Technology", and it's now online and linked above. I took the opportunity to talk about infrastructure and other systems, building on what I wrote in (link: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/gratitude-for-invisible-systems/526344/ text: this piece) for the Atlantic in 2017.
