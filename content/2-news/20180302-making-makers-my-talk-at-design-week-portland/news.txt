In April 2016 I gave a talk as part of (link: https://www.designweekportland.com/ text: Design Week Portland), which focused on making and education. In it, I describe how making is an important part of education not because students make things, but because the way we teach making in classrooms fosters motivation and engagement, and I argue that we should extend these pedagogical approaches across the curriculum.
