My friend Tom Nealon, bookseller and (link: https://www.pazzobooks.com/pages/books/046367/nealon-tom/food-fights-culture-wars-a-secret-history-of-taste text: food and cookbook historian), came to me with an intriguing question: could I think of any reason why mid-17th century pies were so oddly shaped? I asked him a number of questions and gave it some thought, but a possible answer hit me while I was loading paper into a photocopier, and it reminded me of something visible on my daily commute through Boston.
