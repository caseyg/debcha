  title: Materials engineering, by bees
  sentence: >
    Investigating plastic nest cell linings
    made by bees.
  paragraph: >
    Everyone knows about honeybees and
    bumblebees, but my favourite species is
    Colletes inaequalis, found across the
    northeast United States. In the
    springtime, they dig underground nests,
    which they line with a clear
    cellophane-like polyester. Our lab
    showed that these plastic nest cells are
    also reinforced with silk, making them a
    close cousin to fiberglass. Read more.

  title: Comic books meet gender schemas
  sentence: >
    Gender schemas in the comic book Bitch
    Planet.
  paragraph: 'I wrote an essay about gender schemas and the accumulation of advantage for the January 2016 issue of Kelly Sue DeConnick and Valentine De Landro’s brilliant feminist dystopian comic book Bitch Planet. At the moment, the full essay is only available in that issue, but Virginia Valian’s Why So Slow: The Advancement of Women, the book that inspired and shaped the essay, is in libraries everywhere.'

  title: Rethinking making TEST
  sentence: >
    Our society overvalues making and
    underappreciates other labour.
  paragraph: >
    ‘Making’ has become something of a
    buzzword in education. I wrote an essay
    for The Atlantic about its primacy in
    technology culture, and how this stems
    from our collective societal bias
    towards things that can be boxed and
    sold. I made a case to recognise and
    value caregiving and other work, mostly
    performed by women, that isn’t
    considered ‘making’.

  title: Codesigning learning experiences
  sentence: >
    Creating new learning experiences for
    engineering students.
  paragraph: >
    Olin College of Engineering, where I’m
    a faculty member, is a small college
    committed to innovation in engineering
    education. We’re rethinking how we
    teach engineering and designing learning
    experiences that are student-centered,
    that reflect our understanding of and
    research in educational psychology, and
    that prepare technologists who can make
    an impact in the 21st century. As part
    of this, my colleagues and I work
    closely with faculty around the world to
    help them create experiences for their
    own students. Learn more about the Olin
    College Collaboratory.

    The military roots of tech culture in
    the Bay Area
  sentence: >
    How military infrastructure shaped Bay
    Area tech culture.
  paragraph: 'In the spring of 2016, I collaborated with Georgina Voss, Sherri Wasserman and Ingrid Burrington on Situated Systems, the inaugural project of the Experimental Research Lab at Autodesk’s Pier 9 creative fabrication facility in San Francisco. The project focused on the ongoing influence of military infrastructure on technology culture in the Bay Area and beyond, with a focus on carrying out and communicating our research by creating artifacts in addition to more traditional documentation.
