    Issues around gender and STEM (science,
    technology, engineering and mathematics)
    have been a running theme in my
    professional work.

It’s an ongoing theme of my research in engineering education, and my colleagues and I regularly run workshops on gender and STEM for engineering and other educators. I’ve also written, spoken, and consulted on gender and inclusivity to broader audiences, ranging from writing for a comic book, to speaking at the SXSW Interactive Conference, to consulting work with the senior leadership of an advertising agency.'

    ### Partway to Gender Parity
    
    > We now share the data showing gender differences with students as they start their projects, and ask them to think about why they believe those disparities occurred.

    ### To reduce gender biases, acknowledge them
    
    A former Google engineer’s memo on diversity reveals psychological blind spots, not biological differences, says Debbie Chachra.

    ### Exploring Gender and Self-Confidence in Engineering Students: a Multi-Method Approach
    
    Despite generally higher academic achievement, female students display lower academic self- confidence than males. Of particular interest to engineering educators is the difference in confidence in mathematical or scientific skills. Gender differences among engineering students have been explored by the Persistence in Engineering survey, a component of the Academic Pathways Study (APS), a multi-method longitudinal study...

    Interactive Panel: Improving the Experiences of Marginalized Students on Engineering Design TeamsIt is widely recognized that collaborative learning (i.e., group work) benefits student learning bycreating an educational environment in which students achieve higher grades, learn at a deeperlevel and retain information longer. However, group work is fraught with challenges...
