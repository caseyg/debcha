  text: 'Issues around gender and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) have been a running theme in my professional work. It begins, of course, with my own experiences in engineering (including being an undergraduate student at the time of the [Ecole Polytechnique shootings](https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry/letters/metafoundry-17-twenty-five-years-later)), and carries through my work with students at [Olin College](http://www.olin.edu), which has had an institutional commitment to gender parity since its very first class. It’s an ongoing theme of my research in engineering education, and my colleagues and I regularly run workshops on gender and STEM for engineering and other educators. I’ve also written, spoken, and consulted on gender and inclusivity to broader audiences, ranging from writing for a comic book, to speaking at the SXSW Interactive Conference, to consulting work with the senior leadership of an advertising agency.'
