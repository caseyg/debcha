          <b>ENGINEERING EDUCATION</b><br>I am working to make engineering education more effective, responsive and inclusive. Besides my teaching at Olin College and my own research on the engineering student experience, I speak and write widely, and also work closely with faculty around the world to help them redesign learning experiences, primarily as part of Olin’s <a href="http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/collaboratory/">Collaboratory</a>.

          <b>GENDER ISSUES</b><br>Issues related to gender, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), have been an ongoing theme of my professional life, reflected in my teaching and research projects as well as consulting, workshops and talks, and writing, including this piece on <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/">gender and the maker movement</a> and this <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/to-reduce-gender-biases-acknowledge-them-1.22502">editorial on gender biases</a> for Nature.

          <b>MATERIALS SCIENCE</b><br>My engineering background is in materials science, with an emphasis on biological materials. Some of my research interests include how bone changes in response to aging, its environment and disease; collagen and collagenous tissues; and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/from-pollen-to-polyester/">plastic made by bees</a>.

        <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 mb-3">
          <b>TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE</b><br>I write about the intersection of technology and culture, from the <a href="http://hilobrow.com/2015/05/06/stuffed-7-pie-shapes/">shapes of medieval pies</a> to appreciating the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/08/charities-government-civilised-society">sociotechnical systems</a> that underpin modern society. My newsletter, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry">Metafoundry</a>, was <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/rise-of-the-newsletter/">described</a> in WIRED magazine as a ‘<a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/09/21-must-follow-feeds-world-business/">must-follow feed</a>’ and as ‘being plugged Oculus-style into her brain while she meditates on science and culture’.<br>
