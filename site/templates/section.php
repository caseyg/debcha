        Issues around inclusivity and diversity, particular as they relate to gender and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) have been a running theme in my professional work.
      </p>
      <p>It begins, of course, with my own experiences in engineering (including being an undergraduate student at the time of the Ecole Polytechnique shootings), and carries through in my work with students at Olin College, which has had an institutional commitment to gender parity since its very first class. It’s an ongoing theme of my research in engineering education, and my colleagues and I regularly run workshops on gender and STEM for engineering and other educators. I’ve also written, spoken, and consulted on gender to broader audiences, ranging from writing for the comic book Bitch Planet and for the scientific journal Nature, to speaking at the SXSW Interactive Conference, to consulting work with the senior leadership of an advertising agency.</p>
